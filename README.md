# artifact-submit-action

ðŸš§ This repository is under construction. ðŸš§

This is a GitHub Action used to validate artifacts submitted to Ace Archive and
upload submitted artifact files to the site.

Artifact submissions are JSON files in
[acearchive/artifact-submissions](https://github.com/acearchive/artifact-submissions)
which are generated by a form on the Ace Archive site. This action validates
their syntax against a schema and optionally uploads them to Ace Archive.

Artifact files are stored in [Cloudflare
R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2) and artifact metadata is stored in
[Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-kv-works).
Before a file is uploaded to R2, its hash is validated against the hash included
in the JSON submission file to ensure it has not changed since it was manually
reviewed.

See the [`action.yaml`](./action.yaml) for documentation of the input
parameters. See
[acearchive/artifact-submissions](https://github.com/acearchive/artifact-submissions/tree/main/.github/workflows)
for an example of this action in use.
